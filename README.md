## Exercises and Projects
Exercises are in-class / take-home assignments for practicing or extending material covered in class. Projects are larger assignments to shape your own content. There will be 4 projects over the course of the semester.

## Readings
Readings will be assigned every week. We will discuss the readings in class, in relation to work out in the public and by your peers. Each student must submit 1 question to the class website the night before the assigned reading is due. Questions should be oriented for in-class discussion, directed to your fellow students. Be prepared to discuss the texts in class.

## Presentation
Each student will give a 10-15 minute presentation on a particular topic or artist. You should research your topic and present the class with at least five works that use the web as a medium illustrating this. Format: as appropriate.

Here is a [list of possible topics](https://docs.google.com/a/risd.edu/document/d/1mb4bzsV8bwZhIFoYHjmugoH28f3R903kb_wC8hhdgwo/edit?usp=sharing). Below each topic is a list of designers and artists and works that can serve as a starting point for your research. We can also discuss other topics / artists as possibilities for your research.
